            Anthony Fantano, owner of The Needle Drop, is a popular music reviewer on YouTube. Seemingly a living music
            encyclopedia, his knowledge his vast and his passion is evident. As one of the most respected figures in the
            music appreciation scene, what are his favorite artists? Thanks to
            <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/jaredarcilla/anthony-fantano-reviews" target="_blank">this</a>
            dataset from Jared Arcilla, we can both visualize and analyze Anthony's music taste to find out. This list
            is comprised of all artists that he has done album reviews for at least 3 times from the beginning of his
            channel until mid-2018. This dataset is also almost certainly web scraped from Anthony's video titles and
            descriptions, so many of his older reviews that don't include his explicit number rating are absent.
